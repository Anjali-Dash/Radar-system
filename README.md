# Radar-system using an ultrasonic sensor

This radar system is used to detect objects within a certain range. 
The range depends on the type and capability of the sensor used. 
In this project we will be using an ultrasonic sensor with an minimum range of 20cm.
This repository will be consisting of two types of codes that are used to run the radar system: Arduino IDE code and Processing code
You can simply copy these codes and make modifications and customize it according to your requirements.
Hope this will be helpful, Happy Learning! :)
